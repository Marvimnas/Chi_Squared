# Chi_Squared
This git repository presents an implementation of the Chi-square test in Python.


#Libraries
pandas = to load csv file
scipy.stats = to run the chi-squared test

The code can be accessed [here](Teste_Qui_Quadrado.ipynb).
The csv file used in the example is [here](Base-QuiQuadrado.txt).

Note: The .txt file must be uploaded to a folder in Google Drive, as the code runs in a Google Colab environment using the google.colab.drive library.
